## Summary

This project is the capstone for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. The aim is to predict whether the Falcon 9 first stage will successfully land, helping both SpaceX and potential competitors to optimize launch operations and costs.

- **Data Sources:**  
  SpaceX public API, Wikipedia, and course-provided CSV files.
- **Data Wrangling:**  
  Collected and cleaned data to extract landing outcomes as labels for machine learning.
- **Visualization:**  
  Used SQL queries, static and interactive charts, Folium maps, and a Plotly Dash dashboard.
- **Prediction:**  
  Applied and compared Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) models.

## Introduction

The commercial space race is highly competitive.  
**Objective:** Predict the success of Falcon 9 first stage landings to estimate costs and optimize operations.

**Key Questions:**
- What patterns can be found in historical Falcon 9 launch data?
- Which ML model gives the highest prediction accuracy for landings?
- What insights can be drawn from launch sites, payloads, orbits, and booster versions?

---

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**  
   - Downloaded launch data via SpaceX API, Wikipedia tables, and CSV files.
2. **Data Cleaning & Wrangling**  
   - Reformatted mission outcomes into binary labels (success/failure).
   - Processed categorical variables and handled missing values.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualized data trends by launch site, payload, orbit, and date.
   - Used both SQL and Python for querying and plotting.
4. **Geospatial Analysis**  
   - Used Folium maps to analyze launch site proximities and outcomes.
5. **Interactive Dashboard**  
   - Built with Plotly Dash for real-time data exploration and visualization.
6. **Predictive Modeling**  
   - Split data into train/test sets.
   - Trained and tuned Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, and KNN.
   - Compared models using test accuracy and confusion matrices.

## Results

- **EDA Insights:**  
  - Success rates vary significantly by launch site and orbit type.
  - Flight number positively correlates with landing success (experience matters!).
  - The range of 2,000â€“5,000 kg payloads had the highest landing success.
  - 'FT' booster version achieved the highest success rate.
- **Dashboard Insights:**  
  - Interactive site and payload filtering visualized patterns in success/failure rates.
  - KSC LC-39A had the most successful landings; CCAFS SLC-40 had the highest success rate.
- **Model Performance:**  
  - All models achieved **83% test accuracy** (Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, KNN).
  - Confusion matrices confirmed solid class separation.

---

## Conclusion

- SpaceX Falcon 9 landing success rates have significantly improved over time.
- All evaluated machine learning models provided similar predictive power on this dataset.
- Data-driven dashboards and visual analytics offer clear business insights and decision support for future launches.
